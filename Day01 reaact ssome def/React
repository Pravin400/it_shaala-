React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where content is dynamically updated without requiring a full page reload. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, manage application state efficiently, and render changes to the DOM (Document Object Model) effectively. React utilizes a virtual DOM to optimize updates, improving performance by minimizing direct manipulations to the actual DOM. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by a community of developers.
